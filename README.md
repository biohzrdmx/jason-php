# jason-php

A convenient wrapper for JSON documents

Simple to use wrapper to make it even easier to work with JSON documents, loading, saving, accessing and manipulating them.

### Basic usage

First require `biohzrdmx/jason-php` with Composer.

There are four factory methods to create a `Document` instance from various sources:

- `fromArray` - From an array
- `fromString` - From a JSON-encoded string
- `fromFile` - From a JSON-encoded file
- `fromStream` - From a JSON-encoded stream

```php
$document = Document::fromFile('/home/your-user/credentials.json');
```

Also you may use the default `constructor` which takes either an `array` or a `string`.

```php
$payload = [
    'status' => 'accepted',
    'id' => '1234567890',
];
$document = new Document($payload);
```

There are also four output methods to convert the `Document`:

- `toArray` - To an array
- `toString` - To a JSON-encoded string
- `toFile` - To a JSON-encoded file
- `toStream` - To a JSON-encoded stream

```php
$document->toStream($stream_handle);
```

#### Manipulation

To access a `Document` contents you can use the `get` method, which uses _dot notation_ to give you an easy to use interface:

```json
{
    "order": {
        "id": 1234567890,
        "status": "pending",
        "invoice": null,
        "customer": {
            "name": "Bobby Tables"
        },
        "metadata": []
    }
}
```

```php
$customer_name = $document->get('order.customer.name');
```

You can specify a default value in case the item doesn't exist:

```php
$customer_type = $document->get('order.customer.type', 'guest');
```

It also includes a handy `has` method to check for the existence of some value:

```php
if ( $document->has('metadata.processor') ) {
    // Do something
}
```

And you may also build your `Document` from the ground up with the `set` method:

```php
$document = new Document();
$document->set('order' => ['id': 1234567890]);
$document->set('order.status' => 'pending');
$document->set('order.customer' => ['name' => 'Bobby Tables']);
$document->toString(true);
```

```json
{
    "order": {
        "id": 1234567890,
        "status": "pending",
        "customer": {
            "name": "Bobby Tables"
        }
    }
}
```
